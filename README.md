#windows-forensics
the script let the user choose to scan a windows memory file for last active process or extract files from infected hard disk.

This script was implemented as an addition to the volatility tool found at https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility.
and bulk_extractor tool at https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor.

the script was made froms sevral tools with diffrent licenses, therefor all licenses mention above.

the script was made for my personal portfolio to show my abilities, nothing for business or commercial use.
